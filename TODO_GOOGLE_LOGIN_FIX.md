# Google Login Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy Fix

## Problem
Google login was failing with error: "Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy policy would block the window.closed call"

## Root Cause
Browser security policies were preventing the authentication popup from working properly due to cross-origin restrictions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Vite Configuration (vite.config.ts)
- Added server headers configuration:
  - `"Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy": "same-origin-allow-popups"`
  - `"Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy": "unsafe-none"`

### 2. HTML Meta Tags (index.html)
- Added security meta tags:
  - `<meta http-equiv="Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy" content="same-origin-allow-popups">`
  - `<meta http-equiv="Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy" content="unsafe-none">`

## Next Steps

1. **Restart Development Server**
   - Stop the current dev server if running
   - Run `npm run dev` or `bun dev` to start with new configuration

2. **Test Google Login**
   - Navigate to the login page
   - Click "Login with Google" button
   - Verify that the Google authentication popup opens properly
   - Complete the authentication flow

3. **Browser Testing**
   - Test in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari if possible
   - Check browser console for any remaining errors

4. **Production Considerations**
   - For production deployment, ensure proper HTTPS configuration
   - Consider using Firebase Hosting or a similar service that handles security headers automatically

## Additional Notes
- The `same-origin-allow-popups` policy allows popups from the same origin while maintaining security
- `unsafe-none` for Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy allows cross-origin resources to be loaded
- These settings are appropriate for development but should be reviewed for production security requirements

## Files Modified
- `vite.config.ts` - Added server headers configuration
- `index.html` - Added security meta tags

## Status
- [x] Configuration changes implemented
- [ ] Test Google login functionality
- [ ] Verify cross-browser compatibility
